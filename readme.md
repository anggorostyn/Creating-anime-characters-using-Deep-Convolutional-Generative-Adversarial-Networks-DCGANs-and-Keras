# Anime Character Generation using DCGANs

This project demonstrates the use of **Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs)** to automatically generate unique anime-style characters. DCGANs are a combination of **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, designed to create high-quality images that are visually similar to a given dataset.

## Background

In game development, creating unique character designs for each player can be time-consuming and labor-intensive. As the number of players grows, it becomes nearly impossible to manually design unique characters for everyone. This project explores how **GANs** can automate this process. By training DCGANs on a dataset of anime-style images, we can generate new characters with unique features for each player, enhancing their gaming experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Python** for coding and scripting
- **Keras** and **TensorFlow** for building and training the DCGAN model
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data management and mathematical operations
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** for machine learning functions and pipelines

## Setup and Installation

To run this project, make sure you have the following libraries installed. If you are working in a Jupyter Notebook, these libraries may already be pre-installed. If not, use the following command:

```bash
# Install required libraries
!pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib tensorflow keras
